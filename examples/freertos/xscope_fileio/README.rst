XSCOPE File I/O
###############

This FreeRTOS example application reads a WAV file from the host over an XSCOPE server, propagates the data through multiple threads across both tiles, and then writes the output to a WAV file on the host PC, also over an XSCOPE server.

The 3-stage pipeline in the example covers both XCORE tiles. Stage #1 and Stage #2 run on tile[1], while Stage #3 runs on tile[0].

Stages #1 and #2 are implemented in the functions `stage_1` and `stage_2` which can be found in the file ``src\data_pipeline\src\data_pipeline_tile1.c``.  In this example, both stages apply a fixed gain to the PCM audio samples.  In `stage_1`, preemption is disabled with the `rtos_interrupt_mask_all()` function to insure the FreeRTOS kernel does not interrupt the task and perform a context switch during a performance critical code section.  `stage_2` is a typical FreeRTOS task which can be preempted.  However, this example is rather simple so, instead of leaving a context switch up to chance, the `stage_2` function periodically yields to the FreeRTOS kernel - emulating a context switch.

Both the `stage_1` and `stage_2` functions have been instrumented with a stopwatch-like timer to measure the time spent applying the fixed gain.  

Stage #3 is implemented in the function `stage_3` which can be found in the file ``src\data_pipeline\src\data_pipeline_tile0.c``.  In this example, Stage 3 does nothing.  It is provided to demonstrate a multi-tile pipeline.  

The example application input file name is hard-coded to `in.wav` and the output file file name is hard-coded to `out.wav`.  Running the application can be wrapped in a simple script if alternative file names are desired.  Simply copy your file to `in.wav`, run the applications, then copy `out.wav` to you preferred output file name.

The input file sample rate must be 16 KHz, 32 bits per sample. 

This example is already configured to link with the `XMOS vectorized math library <https://www.xmos.ai/documentation/XM-014660-LATEST/html/modules/core/modules/xs3_math/lib_xs3_math/doc/index.html>`_.  Users wishing to take advantage of the vector processing unit (VPU) on the XMOS XS3 architecture can use this example application as a starting point.

******************
Supported Hardware
******************

This example is supported on the XCORE-AI-EXPLORER board.

Building the Firmware
*********************

Run the following commands in the root folder to build the embedded application using the XTC Toolchain:

Linux or Mac
------------

.. code-block:: console

    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
    cd build
    make example_freertos_xscope_fileio

Windows
-------

Before building the embedded application, you may need to add the path to nmake to your PATH variable.

.. code-block:: console

    set PATH=%PATH%;<path-to-nmake>

To build the embedded application:

.. code-block:: console

    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
    cd build
    nmake example_freertos_xscope_fileio

*********************
Building the Host App
*********************

Run the following commands in the root folder to build the host application using your native x86 Toolchain:

.. note::
    
    Permissions may be required to install the host applications.

Linux or Mac
------------

.. code-block:: console

    cmake -B build_host
    cd build_host
    make xscope_host_endpoint
    make install

The host application, `xscope_host_endpoint`, will be installed at `/opt/xmos/SDK/<sdk version>/bin/`, and may be moved if desired.  You may wish to add this directory to your `PATH` variable.

Windows
-------

Before building the host application, you will need to add the path to the XTC Tools to your environment.

.. code-block:: console

    set "XMOS_TOOL_PATH=<path-to-xtc-tools>"

Then build the host application:

.. code-block:: console

    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -B build_host
    cd build_host
    nmake xscope_host_endpoint
    nmake install

The host application, `xscope_host_endpoint.exe`, will be install at `<USERPROFILE>\.xmos\SDK\<sdk version>\bin\`, and may be moved if desired.  You may wish to add this directory to your `PATH` variable.

********************
Running the Firmware
********************

From the build folder run:

Linux or Mac
------------

.. code-block:: console

    make run_example_freertos_xscope_fileio

In a second console, run the host xscope server:

.. code-block:: console

    ./xscope_host_endpoint 12345

Windows
-------

.. code-block:: console

    nmake run_example_freertos_xscope_fileio


Before running the host application, you may need to add the location of the `xscope_endpoint.dll` to your PATH.

.. code-block:: console

    set PATH=%PATH%;<path-to-xscope-endpoint-dll>

In a second console, run the host xscope server:

.. code-block:: console

    xscope_host_endpoint.exe 12345
