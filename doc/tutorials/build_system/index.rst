Build System
############

This document describes the `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_-based build system used by the example applications in the XCORE SDK.  The build system is designed so a user does not have to be an expert using CMake.  However, some familiarity with CMake is helpful.  You can familiarize yourself by reading the `Cmake Tutorial <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html>`_ or `CMake documentation <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.20/>`_.

Check the :ref:`system requirement prerequisites <sdk-prerequisites>` for the supported versions of CMake.

********
Overview
********

An XCORE SDK project can be seen as an integration of several modules. For example, for a FreeRTOS application that captures audio from PDM microphones and outputs it to a DAC, there could be the following modules:

- The SDK core modules (for debug prints, etc...)
- The FreeRTOS kernel
- Microphone array driver for audio samples
- |I2C| driver for configuring the DAC
- |I2S| driver for output to the DAC
- Application code tying it all together

When a project is compiled, the build system will build all libraries and source files specified by the application.  

**********************
Using the Build System
**********************

Below are some examples ``CMakeLists.txt`` files that should get you started when using the SDK's build system in your own application.  We encourage you to use the SDK's build system as it provides many libraries that can be built and linked with your application.
